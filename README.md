Uber Ride Data Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about customer behavior and ride demand. Using Python and data analysis libraries, the notebook explores key metrics such as ride frequency, popular times, distances, and cost distributions.

Objectives

Clean and preprocess Uber ride dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Identify ride demand by time, date, and location

Visualize patterns in distance, fare, and trip duration

Provide actionable insights for business decisions

 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tool: Jupyter Notebook

 Key Insights

Peak ride demand observed during morning and evening hours

Weekends show higher average trip distance compared to weekdays

Certain pickup locations contribute the majority of rides

Correlation found between distance and fare amount
